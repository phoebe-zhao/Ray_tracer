Compilation: 
premake4/make combination 
execute on command line using  ./A4 sample.lua for sample.lua
./A4 Assets/filename.lua for other files in assets

wrintten in xcode
run on gl38.student.cs 

Manual:
implement one extra feature: mirror reflection,  in sample.png
I use this feature, you need to cancel the comment in A4.hpp to activate the REFLECTION

My own lua file is sample.lua under A4 which tests all features

In Mesh.cpp I implemented the Bounding Volume, to use this function, need to cancel the comment in Mesh.hpp. The piecture I generated using this mode is macho-cows-bb.png.
